# Controller

Until now we've happily talked about topics and partitions, leaders and followers without considering where these things come from, or how they're managed.
For Kafka to work there needs to be a way to manage these and other concerns, and that's the job of the controller.

The nature of the controller has changed with the transition from ZooKeeper-based clusters to ones using Kraft, but certain things remain constant:

* The controller is network accessible, handling administrative requests.
* The actual work is done on a single thread, which makes thread safety and semantics much simpler to reason about.

Things that have changed include:

* With ZooKeeper the controller is always one of the brokers and any broker is eligible to be the controller. 
With Kraft, there's more flexibility, and a dedicated pool of servers can be used for the Raft quorum with the leader of the quorum being the controller. 
* Where persistent data is stored: With ZooKeeper this was always in znodes. 
With Kraft a special log file is used.

// TODO ISR and metadata

// TODO controller architecture

## Reassignment

// TODO note difference between purgatory-style IO thread decoupling and the explicitly asynchronous API for reassignment.
