## Motivating questions

. What is the only Kafka RPC request that lacks a response?
. Can a zombie idempotent producer get fenced?
. What producer-related state resides on a partition leader?
. How are zombie producers prevented from writing duplicate records?
. Which broker acts as transaction coordinator?
. What is a control batch used for?
. What logs might be needed to resolve a problem with transactions?

## The simple producer

Having done bootstrapping the simple producer can just start sending produce requests.
